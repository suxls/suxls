“I heard this story about a fish. He swims up to this older fish and says, "I'm trying to find this thing they call the ocean." "The ocean?" says the older fish. "That's what you're in right now." "This?" says the young fish. "This is water. What I want is the ocean." - *Soul, 2020*

## Hi there! I'm Xiaole 

I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Northeastern University, passionate about building products that make a real impact on the communities around me — tools that are not only technically thoughtful and visually intuitive, but also spark joy for the people who use them and the people who build them alongside me.
